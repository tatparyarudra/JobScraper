# Job Scraper — Automating Job Search with Python

In today’s fast-moving world, manually browsing through job listings can be time-consuming.  
To solve this problem, I built **Job Scraper** — a Python-based tool that automatically extracts job opportunities from various websites, saving time and effort.

## Key Highlights

- **Automated Scraping:** Collects job titles, companies, locations, and application links.
- **Flexible Filters:** Search by keywords, locations, and customize output formats (CSV/JSON).
- **Scalable Design:** Easily extendable to multiple job portals with modular scraper scripts.
- **Efficient & Safe:** Includes error handling, request retries, and optional proxy rotation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Pandas for data export
- (Optional) Selenium for dynamic content scraping

## How It Works

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Configure your search criteria (like "Python Developer in Bangalore").
4. Run the script and get a neatly structured output of live job listings.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a practical project that combines web scraping, data processing, and automation — key skills every developer should master.  
It also showcases how simple scripts can create real-world impact by saving time and streamlining workflows.
